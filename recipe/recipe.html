    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour (375 grams)</li>
        <li>2 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk (240 ml)</li>
        <li>¼ cup sour cream (60 ml)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon almond extract</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter (226 grams)</li>
        <li>2 cups granulated sugar (400 grams)</li>
        <li>6 large egg whites</li>
        <li>½ - ¾ cup sprinkles</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instruction</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 335F (165C) degrees. Line the bottom of two 8-inch round pans* with high sides with parchment paper. Then grease and flour the sides of the pans</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl sift together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Give it a whisk so that everything is evenly mixed</li>
        <li>In a large liquid measuring jug or medium bowl, whisk together the milk, sour cream, vanilla extract, almond extract and oil.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl beat the butter and sugar until fluffy (about 5 minutes).</li>
        <li>Beat in the egg whites about 1-2 egg whites at a time. . Turn off the mixer and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as necessary.</li>
        <li>With the mixer on low speed, beat about ⅓ of the flour mixture into the butter mixture. Then mix in about ½ of the liquid ingredients. Repeat the process, mixing in about another ⅓ of the flour mixture, followed by the rest of the milk. Then mix in the last ⅓ of the flour mixture.</li>
        <li>Stop mixing as soon as everything is combined.</li>
        <li>Using a rubber spatula, gently fold in the sprinkles. Be very gentle, or the color will bleed into the cake batter.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter evenly between the prepared pans and gently spread the top smooth.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 32-37 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Cool the cakes in their pans for about 15-20 minutes, then gently invert the cake pans to remove the cakes. Continue cooling on a wire cooling rack. To cool the cakes more quickly, wrap in plastic and place in the freezer. The plastic will keep the moisture in.</li>
    </ul>
